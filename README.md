# Factory and Singleton Pattern example - Logger module

This project is a simple logger implementation to demonstrate the capabilities of the [Factory pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm) when used together with the [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).
It is made in Python 3.10 with 0 dependencies to install. Running is as simple as `python3 src/main.py`.

Pull requests with new features, refactors, better/more complete implementations, exception handling and/or better coverage of edge cases are very welcome!
